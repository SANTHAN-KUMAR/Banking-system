# üöÄ Hybrid Banking System ‚Äî Next-Gen Tamper-Proof, Fraud-Resistant Banking Platform

[![Build Status](https://github.com/SANTHAN-KUMAR/Banking-system/actions/workflows/maven-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SANTHAN-KUMAR/Banking-system/actions/workflows/maven-publish.yml)

---

## ‚≠êÔ∏è What Makes This Project Unique?

This is NOT a typical banking CRUD app.  
**It‚Äôs a hybrid system fusing blockchain-style immutability with real-world banking compliance and security.**

- **Immutable Ledger:** Every transaction is cryptographically chained; tampering is instantly detectable via hash-chain verification.
- **Real-Time Fraud Alerts:** Automated, rules-based fraud detection triggers alerts for large, frequent, or suspicious transactions.
- **Controlled Reversibility:** Only authorized admins/employees can reverse transactions‚Äîeach reversal is immutably recorded and linked.
- **Role-Based Access (RBAC) & KYC:** Fine-grained permissions and full KYC workflow.
- **Proven Security:** Passwords & transaction PINs are hashed (BCrypt). No secrets in code.

## üè¶ Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba299f4b-be23-478b-85eb-59ba17c22062)

- **Tech Stack:** Java 17+, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA (Hibernate), Thymeleaf, MySQL/H2, Maven.
- **Core Services:** `UserService`, `AccountService`, `TransactionService`, `FraudAlertService`, `HashUtil`
- **Security:** BCrypt password & PIN hashing, RBAC via Spring Security, CSRF/session protection for web forms.

---

## üîí Security & Integrity Highlights

- **Password & Transaction PIN Hashing:** All credentials are stored securely (BCrypt, never plaintext).
- **Tamper-Evident Ledger:** Transaction hashes (SHA-256) chain every action; admin can verify ledger integrity from UI.
- **RBAC:** Only authorized users can access or modify sensitive data and actions.
- **No Hardcoded Secrets:** Remove or use environment variables for all credentials‚Äîsee `application.properties` for examples.
- **CSRF & Session Security:** Enabled for all web forms; APIs secured via roles.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Why This Matters (The ‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù Not Just the ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù)

- **Immutable Audit Trail:** Proves integrity of every record‚Äîauditors, regulators, and customers can trust the data.
- **Proactive Security:** Fraud alerts are generated automatically, reducing risk and response times.
- **Reversibility with Accountability:** Transaction reversals are possible for compliance‚Äîbut every reversal is visible and auditable.
- **Hybrid Compliance:** Combines the best of blockchain (transparency, immutability) and banking (control, reversibility, KYC).

---

## üö¶ Quickstart: Running Locally

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SANTHAN-KUMAR/Banking-system.git
   cd Banking-system/Project\ files
   ```

2. **Set up MySQL:**
   - Create a database: `banking_system`
   - Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your DB credentials.

3. **Configure mail (optional, for OTP):**
   - Set environment variables or edit `application.properties` for SMTP details.

4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. **Access in browser:**  
   `http://localhost:8080`

*If not present, create users via registration and promote via DB or admin dashboard.*

---

## üß™ Running Tests

---


---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security/Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Remove all test/demo credentials and secrets before production.
- [ ] Use environment variables for sensitive config (DB, SMTP, etc.).
- [ ] Run with `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate` in production.
- [ ] Add HTTPS, advanced audit logging, and more tests for real deployment.

# üöÄ How to Set Up and Run the Hybrid Banking System (For Absolute Beginners)

Welcome! If you have **zero Java or Spring Boot experience**, you can still set up and run this project by following these steps carefully.

---

## 1. **Prerequisites ‚Äî Get These Tools First**

- **Java 17 or higher**  
  - Download: [Adoptium (Recommended)](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17)
  - After install:  
    - Open a terminal/cmd and run:  
      `java -version`  
      (Should print something like `17.0.x` or higher)

- **Maven (build tool)**  
  - *You don‚Äôt need to install it separately!* This project includes the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw` or `mvnw.cmd`), so you‚Äôre good as long as you have Java.

- **MySQL Server**  
  - Download: [MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
  - After install:  
    - Use MySQL Workbench or CLI to create a database:  
      ```sql
      CREATE DATABASE banking_system;
      ```
    - Remember your MySQL username and password!

---

## 2. **Clone the Project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SANTHAN-KUMAR/Banking-system.git
cd Banking-system/Project\ files
```
*(if you‚Äôre on Windows, use `cd "Project files"`)*
---

## 3. **Configure Database and Email Settings**

- Open `src/main/resources/application.properties` in a text editor.
- Change these lines to match your MySQL setup:
  ```
  spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_username
  spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password
  ```
- (Optional) **Email sending for OTPs:**  
  - By default, it‚Äôs configured for Gmail SMTP.
  - For local testing, you can ignore errors or use a **fake SMTP** service like [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/).

---

## 4. **Run the Application**

### **On Windows**
```bash
./mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```
### **On Mac/Linux**
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

- The app will download dependencies (first run may take a few minutes).
- If you see `Started BankingSystemApplication`, it‚Äôs running!

---

## 5. **Access the App**

- Open your browser and go to:  
  [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

---

## 6. **Register or Log In**

- Register as a new user, or use demo credentials (see README).
- If you want to test Admin/Employee features, use the default test users (if present), or promote yourself via the database.

---

## 7. **Troubleshooting ‚Äî Common Errors**

- **Port 8080 already in use?**
  - Stop other running servers (like Tomcat, another Java app) or change `server.port` in `application.properties`.

- **Database connection error?**
  - Double check your MySQL is running and credentials in `application.properties` are correct.
  - Database `banking_system` must exist.

- **Email errors on registration?**
  - For local demo, you can ignore. Email sending is needed only for OTP verification.

- **Build failures about Java version?**
  - Make sure `java -version` says at least 17.

---

## 8. **How to Contribute (For Beginners)**

- **Don‚Äôt know Java?**  
  - Start with `src/main/resources/templates/` ‚Äî these are HTML files (Thymeleaf) that control the UI.
- Want to change logic?  
  - Explore `src/main/java/com/santhan/banking_system/controller/` for web endpoints.

- **Need help?**  
  - Open a GitHub issue or discussion in this repo!

---

## 9. **Resetting Database (for a clean slate)**

- If you change transaction hash/date logic, or want to wipe all data, run in MySQL:
  ```sql
  DROP DATABASE banking_system;
  CREATE DATABASE banking_system;
  ```
- (Or set `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create` for auto-wipe on restart.)

---

## 10. **Extra Tips**

- **Don‚Äôt edit credentials in code for production!** Use environment variables.
- **For Mac/Windows, file paths and commands are case sensitive**‚Äîcopy carefully.
