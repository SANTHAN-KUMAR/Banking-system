**Goal:** Complete all remaining high-priority features and hardening tasks in just 3 days.  
**Focus:** Core hybrid banking differentiators, operational tools, essential UX, security, and documentation.

## **Day 1: Controlled Reversibility & Fraud Alert Management**

### 1. Controlled Reversibility (Transaction Reversal System)
- **Morning:**
  - Design database changes (if needed) for reversal tracking (reversal reason, linked transaction, status).
  - Implement reversal initiation logic in `TransactionService` and `AccountService`.
  - Secure reversal endpoints in `AdminController` (restrict to ADMINS, add double-confirm for high amounts).
- **Afternoon:**
  - Update ledger logic to record reversals as new transactions, referencing the original.
  - Build/modify admin panel UI for: viewing transactions, initiating reversals, entering reason codes.
  - Implement audit logging for all reversal actions.
- **Evening:**
  - Test full reversal workflow (happy path + edge cases: insufficient rights, wrong status, double reversal, etc.).
  - Add error handling and user feedback on UI.

### 2. Fraud Alert Management & Escalation
- **Night:**
  - Refine fraud alert dashboard for admin/employee (filter, search, escalation).
  - Add note-taking, status change, and escalation flows.
  - Implement auto-blocking logic for repeated unresolved alerts (with unblock override).
  - Ensure all actions are logged immutably.

## **Day 2: Account Statement Download, User Profile, Security, Admin UX**

### 3. Account Statement Generation & Download
- **Morning:**
  - Implement service methods to fetch transactions for a user/account in a date range.
  - Generate PDF/CSV statements (use a Java PDF/CSV library or simple text export).
  - Add statement download buttons to account and transaction pages.
  - Include opening/closing balances and a ledger hash for integrity.

### 4. User Profile Management
- **Afternoon:**
  - Build profile view/update UI (Thymeleaf), except for username.
  - Validate email uniqueness and provide clear error feedback.
  - Update `UserService` for safe, transactional profile updates.

### 5. Security Enhancements
- **Evening:**
  - Review all admin/employee endpoints for role-based access.
  - Add 2FA or transaction PIN field (if time permits) for sensitive actions.
  - Audit and fix missing error handling/logging for critical actions.

### 6. Admin/Employee Panel Usability
- **Night:**
  - Refine admin/employee dashboards: add links, filters, export options, navigation improvements.
  - Ensure all operational flows (fraud, reversal, account/user management) are easily accessible and actionable.

## **Day 3: Testing, Error Handling, Documentation, Final Review**

### 7. Testing & Error Handling
- **Morning:**
  - Write and expand unit tests for all new/modified services and controllers.
  - Add integration tests for reversal and fraud workflows.
  - Test role-based access and edge cases.
  - Manually test all major flows as all user roles.

### 8. Documentation & User Guidance
- **Afternoon:**
  - Update README and user/admin manuals for all new features.
  - Add in-app help text/tooltips for reversal, fraud, and statement features.
  - Document audit and security mechanisms for future audits.

### 9. Final Security, Code, and UX Review
- **Evening:**
  - Perform a code review (self or with a peer) for critical security/logic bugs.
  - Verify that all logs, audits, and error messages are clear and actionable.
  - Polish UI, fix any last-minute bugs, ensure consistent look and feel.
  - Prepare a final handoff/demo checklist.

## **Pro Tips for Rapid Progress**
- **Prioritize working code over perfection:** Focus on “done, tested, and usable” for each feature.
- **Commit and push at least every couple of hours.**
- **If stuck, stub out a minimal version and mark TODOs for polish if time remains.**
- **Keep security and audit logging non-negotiable.**
- **After any change to transaction/hash logic, RESET the DB (ddl-auto=create).**
- **Test as all roles (admin, employee, user) after each major change.**

**You can do this! Stay focused, work in features not files, and keep marking off tasks. If you need code stubs or UI templates for any part, just ask!**
